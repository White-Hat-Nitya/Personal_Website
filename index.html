        <h1>Aphri</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to my website called aphri!,
            It has information about me and also some nice games to play (not here as of yet)
            It also has some Artificial Intelligence too, like a music player to play your favorite songs. A Picture taker, and so much more!
            So maybe you should stick around to see how this is like in a few months.
